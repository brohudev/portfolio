# Personal Portdolio Site

Self Explanatory. I have always felt the need to create a personal portfolio but the itch wasnt irritating enough... until now. 

This repo contains the code for V1 release of my portfolio. 

... mmmhowever, as you can tell by looking at `devnotebook.md`, I want quite a bit much from my portfolio, so I will be working on V2 in the meantime.
